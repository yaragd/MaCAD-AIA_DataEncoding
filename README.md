Predicting Direct Sun Impact in an Urban Context 


Due to the rapid evolution of urban centers, climate impact has become a global issue to existing and future development. However, with the evolution of digital technologies, new tools can be integrated into early design phases to help designers identify issues that can help to minimize environmental impact in cities.   
In an urban context, thermal comfort can be calculated parametrically generating data that potentially would be applicable in ML. In this case study, predicting direct sun impact on a fixed urban context while projecting iterative building parameters in a fixed urban context to generate dataset which results in different prediction values such as shade area ratio for a given context to enhance thermal comfort in the built environment and the urban landscape. The method this project approaches is to generate an
environmental dataset for the city of Sydney, Australia where sun hours are calculated in a specific urban context. Environmental data has been used through the Ladybug component and EPW files to simulate solar data. Speculating parametrically a building design for the site in terms of building height, width, length, and rotation angle as inputs while the annual sun path by hour is calculating the direct sun impact on the site. The output of 2000 samples for the ML to train on are values for how many hours each site grid was exposed to direct sun throughout the year based on the iterative building parameters. Where then, the ML is trained to predict the cells for the lowest values of direct sun impact on the site. Mainly, the architecture of ML used for prediction is to train the dataset generated by multiple regression model.  As a result, this process provides an immediate result for a specific building envelope that can lead to better thermal comfort and faster design solutions. 


// Directions: 
There are two scenarios in this repo to perform direct sun prediction on an urban context. Choose one of them and follow the steps bellow: 
1.	 Clone the repository. 
2.	In the Colab Notebook, choose one of the scenarios to run the PCA analysis as well as to train the model. 
3.	Once the model is trained, export the .h5 and make sure you have your scalerx and scalery downloaded as well in one folder in your VCS project. 
4.	Add and replace the .h5, scalerX, and scalerY files to the VCS folder in both apps.py and runPythonapp.py files. 
5.	Open the provided Grasshopper file and load the provided URL from the Visual Studio terminal into Hops
